            <p>
                Amador Live Eatery and Entertainment District is a multi-venue establishment with two bars and two restaurants.
                Amador Live hosts high-profile events such as concerts and movie premieres, many of which are sold-out shows.
                These events require strong time management skills, extensive knowledge of the drink and food selections available,
                and effective communication to answer guest questions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Responsibilities as the Banquet Captain included setting up multiple events such as political ceremonies, weddings,
                fundraisers, and college athletic recruitment events. I ensured that event leaders were satisfied and accommodated by staff.
                Additionally, I assigned roles to other servers and provided solutions for any issues that arose during events.

            <p>
                Double Eagle de Mesilla is a high-end dining restaurant where professionalism is required. As an assistant manager to
                the banquet department, many requirements included running and managing many events over my time there
                including weddings, company dinners, political groups, and many celebrities and high-ranking people such as Elon
                Musk and Richard Branson. As a server, my responsibilities included drink knowledge such as wine pairings and
                alcohol prices as well as availability. Table-side cooking was also required as servers must make salads and desserts in
                front of the guests and supply entertainment well doing so.
