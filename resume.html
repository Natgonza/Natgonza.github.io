                <h4>Amador Hospitality Inc. - Las Cruces, NM</h4>


                <p>
                    Amador Live Eatery and Entertainment District is a multi-venue establishment with two bars and two restaurants.
                    Amador Live hosts high-profile events such as concerts and movie premieres, many of which are sold-out shows.
                    These events require strong time management skills, extensive knowledge of the drink and food selections available,
                    and effective communication to answer guest questions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Responsibilities as the Banquet Captain included setting up multiple events such as political ceremonies, weddings,
                    fundraisers, and college athletic recruitment events. I ensured that event leaders were satisfied and accommodated by staff.
                    Additionally, I assigned roles to other servers and provided solutions for any issues that arose during events.

                <h4>New Mexico Vintage Wines - Mesilla, NM</h4>

                <p>
                    New Mexico Vintage Wines is a wine shop/bar that has live music every weekend, the responsibilities required are
                    knowledge of wines and wine pairing as well as recommendations, making and distribution of drinks(as there are no
                    servers), preparation of simple foods such as charcuterie boards, as well as taking inventory after every shift and
                    communication to management as well as other staff members what is in stock.

                <h4>Double Eagle De Mesilla - Mesilla, NM</h4>

                <p>
                    Double Eagle de Mesilla is a high-end dining restaurant where professionalism is required. As an assistant manager to
                    the banquet department, many requirements included running and managing many events over my time there
                    including weddings, company dinners, political groups, and many celebrities and high-ranking people such as Elon
                    Musk and Richard Branson. As a server, my responsibilities included drink knowledge such as wine pairings and
                    alcohol prices as well as availability. Table-side cooking was also required as servers must make salads and desserts in
                    front of the guests and supply entertainment well doing so.
