            <h2>Welcome to my digital world!</h2>
            <p>Since I built my first computer back in 2020 I discovered a new world in computing.
                I always had a knack when it came to technology but after building my first computer and 
                making my very first "Hello World" program I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in
                programming and cybersecurity. I am currently a student at New Mexico State University for 
                a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I am also studying for my CompTIA Security+ certification.
